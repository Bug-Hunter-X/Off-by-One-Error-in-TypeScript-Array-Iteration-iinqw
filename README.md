This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in TypeScript when iterating over arrays. The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.ts` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from an incorrect loop condition that attempts to access an element beyond the array's bounds. This leads to a runtime error or unexpected behavior. The solution corrects the loop condition to ensure only valid array indices are accessed.
